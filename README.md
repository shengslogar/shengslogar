### Hey there! ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to my... GitHub?? I'm currently hanging out in Milwaukee, Wisconsin building [Diglactic](https://diglactic.com), where we thoughtfully create apps, for humans. Laravel + Vue.js + SCSS are my current go-to.

I like naps, sunsets, and ice cream. Code, too, sometimes. These days you can catch me going gasping for air on a run or gliding along on my [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

Come hang out on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@sheng) or drop an invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengslogar/).

See ya around! ðŸ¥°
