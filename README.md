### Hey there! ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to my... GitHub?? I'm currently hanging out in Utah building [Diglactic](https://diglactic.com) where I'm thoughtfully crafting apps _for humans_ (I know, revolutionary stuff). Laravel + Vue.js + SCSS are my current go-to.

I like naps, sunsets, and ice cream. Code, too, sometimes. This past winter I dived (literally, ouch) into skiing. The rest of the year you can catch me going gasping for air on a run or gliding along on my [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

Come hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShengSlogar) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shengslogar/), or drop an invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengslogar/).

See ya around! ðŸ¥°
