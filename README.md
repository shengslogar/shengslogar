# Hey there, stranger 🌊

Welcome to the wild world of Sheng's code. I'm currently hanging out in Utah building [Diglactic](http://github.com/diglactic), focusing on thoughtfully crafting apps _for humans_.

I like naps, sunsets, and ice cream. And code, sometimes. This past winter I dived (figuratively and literally) into skiing. The rest of the year you can catch me going for a run or gliding (and falling) along on my [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

Come hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShengSlogar), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shengslogar/), or drop an invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengslogar/). See ya soon!
