### Hey there! ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to my... GitHub?? These days I'm building web apps out in ~~freezing~~ humid Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Laravel, Vue.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL make up my stack of choice. Lately, I've been embracing serverless PHP via the wonderful [Bref](https://bref.sh/) library.

I like naps, sunsets, and ice cream. Code, too, sometimes. You might catch me gasping for air on a run or gliding along on my [Onewheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onewheel).

Come hang out on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@shengslogar) or [X](https://x.com/ShengSlogar), or drop an invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengslogar/). Always love connecting with new folks!

See ya around! ðŸ¥°
