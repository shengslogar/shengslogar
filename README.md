### Hey there! ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to my... GitHub?? These days I'm building web apps out in freezing Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Laravel, Vue.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, and MySQL make up my stack of choice.

I like naps, sunsets, and ice cream. Code, too, sometimes. You might catch me gasping for air on a run or gliding along on my [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

Come hang out on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@sheng) or drop an invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengslogar/).

See ya around! ðŸ¥°
